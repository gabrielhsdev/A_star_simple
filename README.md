# A* Pathfinding Algorithm with Pygame

This project is an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm using Python and Pygame for visualization. The A* algorithm finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point on a grid.

## Features

- A* pathfinding algorithm implementation.
- Real-time visualization using Pygame.
- User-defined grid size and start/goal points.
- Separation of concerns using classes for nodes, board, and rendering.
- Clean and modular code structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this program, you must install Python and Pygame on your system. If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/A_star_simple.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the A* pathfinding algorithm visualization.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use the following controls:

   - On main.py, you can set the number of nodes, where the walls are, and start/end coordinates
   - run the main.py file to visualize the program running

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the following:

- Grid size and resolution.
- Start and goal points.
- Obstacle generation.
